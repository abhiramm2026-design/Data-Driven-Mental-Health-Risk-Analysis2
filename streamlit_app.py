In todayâ€™s data-rich environment, demographic, geographic, and lifestyle information can be used
to predict mental health risks and enable proactive interventions. This project integrates two
advanced RNN models to build a decision-support system. Our objectives:

- Identify key risk factors and forecast the likelihood of individuals reporting mental health symptoms.
- Compare patterns across regions (as a proxy for urban vs. rural dynamics).
- Discover risk-based sub-groups via clustering.
- Diagnose mental health disorders from textual statements using an LSTM classifier.

Stakeholders (healthcare providers, employers, educators, NGOs) can use these insights to target
high-risk segments and allocate resources more effectively.

- **Gender patterns** â€” differing reporting/risk patterns across genders in the dataset.
- **Lifestyle factors** â€” chronic stress and negative habit changes increased risk; supportive work-life habits were protective.
